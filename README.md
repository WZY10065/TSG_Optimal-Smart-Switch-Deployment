# Optimal Smart Switch Deployment with Tri-layer Synergized Resilience Enhancement Considering Multiple Heterogeneous Faults

## Introduction
This repository contains datasets and appendices related to the paper titled **"Optimal Smart Switch Deployment with Tri-layer Synergized Resilience Enhancement Considering Multiple Heterogeneous Faults"** by Ziyao Wang, Tao Yu, Pengyi Fan, and Zhenning Pan, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid. The work presents detailed load data and topology data for a 40-bus system and a real 126-node distribution network in Zhuhai Hengqin District.

## Datasets
- **40-bus System Data**: Includes detailed load data and network topology for the 40-node distribution network.
- **126-node Distribution Network Data**: Includes detailed load data and network topology for the real 126-node distribution network in Zhuhai Hengqin District.
