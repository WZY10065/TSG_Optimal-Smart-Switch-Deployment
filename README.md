# Optimal Smart Switch Deployment with Tri-layer Synergized Resilience Enhancement Considering Multiple Heterogeneous Faults

## Introduction
This repository hosts datasets and supplementary materials for the paper **"Optimal Smart Switch Deployment with Tri-layer Synergized Resilience Enhancement Considering Multiple Heterogeneous Faults"** by Ziyao Wang, Tao Yu, Pengyi Fan, Zhenning Pan, and Wei Chen, published in _IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid_ (DOI: 10.1109/TSG.2025.3569999). The study introduces a novel approach for enhancing resilience in distribution networks using remote-controlled switches and soft open points, with data from a 40-bus system and a 126-node real-world network in Zhuhai Hengqin District.

## Datasets
- **40-bus System Data**: Includes detailed load data and network topology for the 40-node distribution network.
- **126-node Distribution Network Data**: Includes detailed load data and network topology for the real 126-node distribution network in Zhuhai Hengqin District.
